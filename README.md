Extra practice for C++

Hello! I am excited to learn some things in C++. My goal is to build a really 
strong foundation to help with developing more advanced skills in the years to come. 
I'm trying to see where I can end up in life by aiming towards the stars, literally. 
I know I am light years away from being able to work in the space industry but it is 
good enough to keep me motivated as a student and as well as in my regular work life.
